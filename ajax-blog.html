<!--Ajax Blog-->
<!--Create a new html file called ajax-blog.html.-->
<!--At minimum, your ajax blog will need an empty <div> with an id of posts.-->
    <!--Add your own Bootstrap theme to this file as well. Feel free to use the same one as your store or choose a different one.-->
    <!--Download blog.json to your data directory from before.-->
    <!--Use ajax to load the contents of blog.json and add the data from it to your #posts div.-->
    <!--Add additional entries to blog.json and make sure your changes are reflected on the page.-->
