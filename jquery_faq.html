<h2>National Park FAQs</h2>
<button class="answer-btn">Toggle Answers</button>
<dl>
    <dt>Where can I find a park map?</dt>

    <dt>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check specific park websites. You can also learn more about camping in national parks and find a map of parks with camping opportunities.</dd>

    <dt>How do I reserve a tour in a park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can book some park tours through Recreation.gov such as WWII Valor in the Pacific (Pearl Harbor), many Mammoth Cave National Park cave tours, Independence National Historical Park tours, and more. Not all parks participate in this reservation service. For more information on tours offered at a specific park, please see the park search.</dd>

<!--Create a button that, when clicked, makes the last li in each ul have a yellow background.-->

<!--When any h3 is clicked, the lis underneath it should be bolded. Use font-weight: bold to achieve this.-->

<!--When any list item is clicked, first li of the parent ul should have a font color of blue.-->

<!--Bonus-->
<!--Create 3 divs that each look like a picture Frame; each one should have a unique background image and a button
underneath that swaps the image from the frame. Use Traversing functions of jQuery to accomplish this.-->

<!--The rules are the following:-->

<!--The left frame swaps to the right and takes the image from the frame in the center.-->
<!--The center frame swaps randomly to either the left or right.-->
<!--The right frame swaps to the left and takes the image from the frame in the center.-->
